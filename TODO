Next Steps
 ☐ Handle the room error/something went wrong state on client
 ☐ Combine all code into one repo
    ☐ Use a game configuration file to determine defaults like speed, ammo etc.
      ☐ something similar for the map?
 ☐ Add ability to leave a room and rejoin another one 
 ☐ Performance???
   ☐ Server
     ☐ Elixir - extreme but possible
     ☐ Separate 'now' deployments
       ☐ would involve some hefty code rewriting (so basically extreme)
     ☐ Do nothing - probably ok for now
   ☐ Client
     ☐ Go through and eliminate re-renders of static objects/unnecessary stuff
       ☐ items could be rendered if they are near a player?
     ☐ WebGL (preferred atm)
     ☐ JS Game Framework (phaser, construct)
     ☐ Web Workers
     ☐ Improve collision detection logic
 ☐ Setup destruction of rooms on a timer after being empty
 ☐ Setup game time length
 ☐ Add some better feedback to the frontend UI
   ☐ highlight your stats box at the side
   ✔ highlight your player character in the canvas @done (16-07-21 20:54)
   ☐ "you died", "you were shot" etc. toasts or notifications
   ✔ health bars @done (16-07-21 20:47)
   ☐ sounds
 ☐ Add Game states to the list in UI

Long term/Maybes
 ☐ Map Editor
 ☐ Private games with passwords
 ☐ Rewrite server code in elixir
 ☐ Find a way to test
